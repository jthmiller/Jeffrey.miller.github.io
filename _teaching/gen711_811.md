The methods, applications, and implications of genomics–the analysis of whole genomes. Microbial, plant and animal genomics are addressed, as well as medical, ethical and legal implications. The lab provides exposure and experience on a range of bioinformatics approaches–the computer applications used in genome analysis. Students will learn command-line basics to generate an analysis on sequencing data. Graduate students are encourage to propose a final project relevant to their own research.
