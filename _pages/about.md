Monitoring Aquatic Communities with Molecular Tools: Environmental DNA
------
1. The impact of barriers and their removal on the Great Bay Watershed. In collaboration with NH Fish & Game, we are sampling the Mill Pond dam on the Oyster River and the Pickpocket dam on the Squamscott / Exeter River. 

Questions include: 

2. Monitoring dyanmic and different estuaries 

3. Tracking the movement of cod and the fish community. 

Turning our attention to the small: Picocyanobacteria in New Hampshire Lakes
------
Pico-sized cyanobacteria are notoriously difficult to study. Like other visible  'bloom-forming' cyanobacteria, some types of picocyanobacteria can synthesize the deadly toxins that close beaches and pose a risk to human health. However, with traditional methods, it is extremely difficult to measure which types of picocyanobacteria pose a risk and which are present in a given sample of water. We can use eDNA to sequence the genomes of picocyanobacteria in a sample, but the resources necessary for matching DNA to toxin producing types are patchy and underdeveloped. 


In collaboration with [Amanda McQuaid](https://extension.unh.edu/person/amanda-mcquaid)
and the [Lay Lakes Monitoring Program](https://extension.unh.edu/natural-resources/land-conservation-water-resources/lakes-lay-monitoring-program), [Peter Countway and Robin Seith](https://www.bigelow.org/about/people/pcountway.html) at Bigelow Marine Lab, and the town of [Wolfeboro, NH](https://www.wolfeboronh.us/wolfeboro-waters-committee), we will target picocyanobacteria from New Hampshire lakes for whole-genome sequencing to assemble genomes, measure the prevalence of toxins and toxin producing genes,
